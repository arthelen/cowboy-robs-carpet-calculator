/* LEVEL UP! (optional) 
	1. Function explanations:
    - getRoomWidth(roomNumber) > this allows the code to get the value the user
    inputted into the text field for the width for room 1 or 2 (depending on the
    number in the parenthesis), which is then stored into the let variable
    room1Width/room2Width that can be used to get the totalArea

    - showResult(totalArea) > this shows the user the total square foot after all
    of the equations have been calculated and the "calculate" button is clicked

	2. Custom styles added: 
    - new logo
    - new font
    - new color palette
    - changed the button, result box, and form box to have rounded edges
